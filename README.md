## Git LFS Setup

Install Git LFS before cloning so that the textures download properly. On macOS use:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

On Debian/Ubuntu use:

```bash
apt install git-lfs
```

After installing, run:

```bash
git lfs install
```

The textures in `public/textures/` are tracked with Git LFS and require LFS to pull successfully.
